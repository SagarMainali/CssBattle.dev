# CssBattleCodes
Practicing CSS in cssbattle.dev

-This repo contains the codes that I wrote while practicing Css in cssbattle.dev. 
-The code written gives output of 100% match.
-Although the main aim of the cssBattle is to include less amount of code as much as possible, I aimed to just have 100% matching which is really fun.
-CssBattle has helped me to learn Css while having fun.
-I am including these code in github for future reference(to compare the way I did in the beginning days vs ....) and making it public so that anyone trying out   cssBattle could also benefit.
-The codes are copy pasted directly from the cssBattle so they are not in a HTML format.
